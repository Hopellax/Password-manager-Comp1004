The password management system is the project in which I have been working on throughout my first year at univeristy for the module comp1004 - computing pratice!

## Whats used?
* The website was developed in React.js
* JSON files are used to recongise user credentials
* AES encryption to keep user information secure

## Features
* Main dashboard area (users information is kept in one place).
* Password generator (can toggle on / off the use of symbols)
* Password strenght checker (works against different factors to determine security level)
